# Citizens of Light Church - Sermon Retrieval Telegram Bot

A sophisticated, AI-powered Telegram bot designed to help church members easily find and access the complete sermon archive of Citizens of Light Church, stored in a Google Sheet.

This bot understands natural language, allowing users to search by topic, preacher, date, or even by describing a situation or feeling.

## Key Features ‚ú®

* **Natural Language Understanding:** Powered by the Google Gemini LLM, the bot can understand complex queries, typos, and contextual requests (e.g., "I'm feeling sad").
* **Thematic Search:** Recommends sermons on themes like "hope," "faith," or "provision" based on the user's situation.
* **Precise Date Search:** Users can ask for sermons preached on a specific date (e.g., "messages from June 11, 2023").
* **Dynamic Results:** Users can ask for a specific number of results (e.g., "give me 3 messages on favour"). Defaults to 10.
* **Intelligent Pagination:** The bot remembers the user's search history for multiple topics, allowing them to ask for "more" and get the next set of results for each topic.
* **Secure and Live 24/7:** Deployed on Render, the bot runs continuously and handles all secret API keys securely using environment variables.
